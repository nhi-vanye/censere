Electricity
-----------

Typical electricity generation on Mars will probably be either RTG or Solar Panels.

RTG provide great base-load generation, but have health and safety
issues (low level radiation). Typical RTG for space craft only
generate a few hundred Watts, so there will either need to be a lot
of them or of a new larger design.

Solar panels will have to deal with the much lower solar levels on
the surface (cf. that on Earth's surface) and dust storms.

On Earth the average solar irradiance is 170 W/m2

To keep things simple, I'd suggest using a stnadard 1m2 panel and
change the count. The downside is that will mean having a high
number of resources for no real benefit, so I suggest using a using
10m2 as the "standard" panel size
